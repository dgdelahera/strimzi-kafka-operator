This chapter describes how to configure different aspects of the supported deployments using custom resources:

* Kafka clusters
* Kafka Connect clusters
* Kafka Connect clusters with _Source2Image_ support
* Kafka MirrorMaker
* Kafka Bridge
* Cruise Control

NOTE: Labels applied to a custom resource are also applied to the Kubernetes resources comprising Kafka MirrorMaker.
This provides a convenient mechanism for resources to be labeled as required.

The _Deploying Strimzi_ guide describes how to link:{BookURLDeploying}#assembly-metrics-str[monitor your Strimzi deployment^].
